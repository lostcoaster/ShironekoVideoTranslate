# ShironekoVideoTranslate
A small tool helping to make translated video of the game Shironeko Project
Automatically detects subtitles boxes in original video and match the timeline. Draws dialog boxes and animations.

Requirement:

1. Qt (5.7 prefered)
2. Opencv (2.4.13 prefered)
3. ffmpeg binary

Status: Abandoned. 
I feel absolutely disappointed by Col\*\*\*'s move and will not bother reading Shironeko's stories any more. Therefore this tool becomes useless.
